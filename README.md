# UTD_parkingLotProject

Implementing a system that manages parking lot using object-oriented principles.

1. The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has a multiple rows of spots.
2. Motorcycles, cars and buses can park. It has motorcycle spot, compact spot and
large spot.
3. A motorcycle can park in any spot.
4. A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.
5. A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and with in the same row. It
cannot park in small spot.

A) Draw a UML class diagram. Identify classes and the relation between them
(for example inheritance or aggregation)
• Use a standard tool to draw UML diagram such as starUML which you
can download it from http://staruml.io/download. Manual UML class
diagrams are not accepted.

B) Convert the class diagram to java classes.
Note:
• NUM_OF_LEVELS = 5
• SPOTS_PER_LEVEL = 30
• SPOTS_PER_ROW = 10
• 20% of spots are large (per level) and they are consecutive with the same
row.
• 20% of spots are motorcycle spots (per level) and they are consecutive with
the same row.
